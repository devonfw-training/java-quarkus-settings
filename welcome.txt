Welcome to Java Backend Advanced training!
IDEasy has automatically installed your local IDE for this project now.
This includes all tools needed for your daily development work as well as plugins needed for your IDEs.
Also git code repositories have been cloned automatically during the setup.

If you just want to use IDEasy as a developer, you should first switch to your new project

icd -p java-quarkus

(in case you called `ide create java-quarkus https://github.com/devonfw-training/java-quarkus-settings.git` before)

Then you can start your favourite IDE by typing e.g.

ide intellij

(or 'ide eclipse', 'ide vscode', 'ide android-studio', 'ide pycharm', ...)
For details check the help:

ide help
